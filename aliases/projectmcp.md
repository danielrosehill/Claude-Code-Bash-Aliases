# Create Project-Level MCP Configuration

Creates an `.mcp.json` file in the current working directory for project-level MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration.

```bash
alias projectmcp='touch .mcp.json && echo "Created .mcp.json"'
```

## Usage

```bash
projectmcp
```

This will create an empty `.mcp.json` file in your current directory, which you can then edit to configure project-specific MCP servers for Claude Code.
