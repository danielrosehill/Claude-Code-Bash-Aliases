I'd like to add a few new bash aliases to support working with Claude Code.

I'll provide the desired functionality.

Then:

Suggest a bash alias 

When approved:

Add per instructions (~/.bash_aliases)

Then:

Run a manual YADM push

## Batch Operation 

Let's try to add these as a batch by identifying a sensible naming pattern and then creating them in bulk.
